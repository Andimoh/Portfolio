Background
My name is Mohammed Abdulkadir, a cybersecurity analyst. I like to think of myself as a multi-disciplined professional that keeps overwatch of Companies assets. I work in a small security team involved in cloud and network security, IOT, incident response and detections. We actively monitor every detection and malicious activity in our network and insider threat including EDR, email security, IDS/IPS and SIEM among others.
