Background
I am an experienced security specialist with a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Science and a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Cybersecurity. My work involves architecting, implementing, and testing new security tool features, as well as proactive monitoring for malicious activity, detection, and incident response, including addressing insider threats. I also have experience in web development, using web technologies to upgrade or build websites for small businesses. Born in Nigeria, I have developed strong cultural fluency through living and working in Canada and the United States.</description>
